#+TITLE: tis-100-mode.el

* Introduction

This major mode provides syntax highlighting for TIS-100 assembly. It
conforms to the publicly released manual and does not include support
for custom or classified extensions.

Note that ~BAK~ is not highlighted, as it is not useful in code.

* Installation

Simply download =tis-100-mode.el= and load it into Emacs.

* Usage

=M-x tis-100-mode RET=. You can also use a mode line, if you have the
storage space to spare:

#+begin_src sh
# -*- mode: tis-100 -*-
#+end_src
